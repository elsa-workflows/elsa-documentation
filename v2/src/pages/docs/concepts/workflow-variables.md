title: Workflow Variables
---

Every workflow instance can have a set of **workflow variables**.

A workflow variable is a simple key/value pair stored as part of the workflow instance, and is useful to store information that can later be used by other activities.

## Default Variables

Although variables can be created on the fly within a workflow as it executes, you can declare variables up-front on the workflow definition itself.
